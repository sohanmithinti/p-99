We live on this Earth along with
millions of other animals, plants and
micro-organisms. Human life evolved
on the earth over one lakh years ago.
More than any other animal, human
beings have been trying to make the
Earth a better place to live in. We have
been constantly trying to change
ourselves and our surroundings.
